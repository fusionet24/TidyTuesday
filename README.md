# TidyTuesday
### Introduction
This repository is for the livestreams that are hosted here: 
They cover R, Python, Power BI, Databricks, SQL and Azure technologies. 

### Why Live?
I think the value of doing things like this live is that you get to see a persons thought process. The scenarios will often be messy and slightly challenging too which hopefully mimics the real world usescases people may have.
I will be solving these problems as I go and often will run into issues that will require some inventive thinking. 

Personally I find that more valuable than just providng you a polished video and polished script. I will give information before each live stream so you can follow along in real time if you want. 

### Week1
This topic is webscraping in R. We will explore building tables of data (dataframes) from website assets. Scenarios will include:
- Extarcting simple and complex tables from a heavily driven CSS website
- Extracting addtional assets such as Images from tables for use.
- Extracting complex data from contents pages and using it to recursively call other webpages to build a dataframe

This can be utilised in R scripts, Power BI data sources, Microsoft SQL R Services etc. 
A few simple and complex real world datasets will be extracted from this website [Super League](https://www.superleague.co.uk/)

### Week 2
*** Coming soon**
Driving Web UI frameworks via R (& Power BI) to interact with websites.


### Week 3
*** No IDEA YET**

### Current Session Ideas
- The power of the Grammar of Graphics

- R Visuals in Power BI
- Building an R API wrapper package
- Power Automate with Cosmos DB and Congitive Services
